What was challenging during this process?
During this process what was challenging was in particular arrenging and getting the colors for the exact shape at the exact amount of color I wanted. This is due to the particular reason that at the begging I completely overlooked the "fill" option.   

What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
What makes more sense now than it did before is why you need to be specific and must label/describe what one is doing as, it supports organization and finding out where one makes mistakes. 
What are you proud of?
I am proud of being able to complete such work and not be "stuck" with it without finding any solution.
